Description
-----------
Implement segment tree with `update` and `sumRange` support.

Approach
--------
Segment tree is 1-indexed array based tree data structure like heap.
N leaf nodes are same as array and parent contains result of operation (sum in this case, can be
anything) of left and right child.

For parent p, left and right child will be at 2*p and 2*p + 1 respectively. Below we have
implemented iterative way, each function doc has implementation detail.

Complexity
----------
Implementing segment tree takes O(2*N) => O(N) space complexity, time complexties of
different operations are listed below:
- Build: O(N)
- Update: O(logN)
- Query: O(logN), sumRange in this case, can be any other operation also

        elements are internal nodes which hold sum (or any other operation result like min, max,
        xor, etc.) of it's child elements. So in segment tree left child is at index 2i and right
        child at index 2i + 1 for parent at index i.

        Also, segment tree is 1-indexed array so 0th position of segment tree is not used - notice
        the loop conditions in build and updated methods.
